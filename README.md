# The Effects of Walkability on Cities in the United States
### *BSAN 360 - Drexel University*

## What is this project?

This is a project for the BSAN 360 course at Drexel University that is meant to analyze the impacts of walkability on cities in the United States. This project utilizes data from the Walkability Index provided by the EPA. You can get the CSV file from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/walkability-index-u-s-protection).

## Why this dataset?

I have always been passionate about urban planning and the urbanism movement as found it interesting to study the impacts of the built environment as well as the economic trends of cities on their walkability. I wanted to study how these factors can effect walkability of cities and if a higher walkability index can correlate to a better quality of life.

## Research Questions

### 1. How does reliance on auto based infrastructure affect the walkability of a community?
